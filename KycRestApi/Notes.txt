Application Core 

Ports/Adapters 
    In Ports (presented as interfaces):
        IAchievement (GetAchievmentFor(CustomerId))
        IContactVerfication (GetVerification(CustomerId))
        IIdentification (GetAssessment(CustomerId))
        ILoayalityProfiler (GetProfile(CustomerId))
        IActivityTracer (StartTracing(CustomerGroupSpecification), StopTracing())
            you will receive alerts for all customers
        

    Controller is part of UI 
        Does also the boot strapping
    Stream is Adapter (Observable is provided by Adapter)
    There is also an outgoing stream (maybe grpc API -> feature live monitoring stream)
        
    Specflow tests are also Part of adapter

    Rules
        *) Registration since one year mandatory (otherwise we set the loyality to 0)
        *) Verification of mobile successful (for bonus promotion) mandatory (otherwise set the loayality to 0)
        *) Last identification not older than 2 years +5 (formula depending on the years e.g.: years*5)
        *) Sum of purchases higher than 100 € +10 (formula depending on the amount e.g.: amount/10)
        *) At least one purchase higher then 10€ in the last month +5
        *) No Fraud Suspections
